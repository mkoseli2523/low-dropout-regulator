 Low Dropout Regulator (LDO)

This project presents the high-level design and simulation of a 1.2V low dropout (LDO) voltage regulator implemented in a 180nm CMOS process. The regulator achieves low quiescent current and strong line/load regulation while maintaining stability and PSR performance across operating conditions.
